8. # Use Case Generator
9. A tool for generating use cases from requirements and user stories.
10. ## Getting Started
11. To use this tool, you'll need to provide it with a set of requirements and user stories. The tool will then generate use cases based on that input.
12. Here's an example of how you can use the tool:
13. ```python
14. from use_case_generator import generate_use_cases
15. requirements = [
16. "Go to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth",
17. "Check the header: This site is asking you to sign in.",
18. "Input username = admin to the field Username",
19. "Input password = admin to the field Password",
20. "Press button Sign in",
21. "Browser page opens and there is two headers",
22. "6.1. Basic Auth",
23. "6.2. Congratulations! You must have the proper credentials."
24. ]
25. user_stories = [
26. "As a user, I want to sign in to the website so I can access my account.",
27. "As a user, I want to see a confirmation message after signing in."
28. ]
29. use_cases = generate_use_cases(requirements, user_stories)
30. for use_case in use_cases:
31. print(use_case)
32. ```
33. This will generate the following use cases:
